# data-code-challenge

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember application.

This is a simple application to display data related to file transfer progress.

Areas for improvement:
* Implement automated tests
* Abstract some helper logic out into services
* Abstract data sorting logic from app/routes/data into service
* Add loading interface when fetching data
* Possibly move header into component

All areas for improvement are implicitly requiring a more thorough understanding of Ember and the proper conventions to follow

ASSUMPTIONS:
* data.remaining is time in milliseconds
* sorting first by if an end_date exists and then in ascending order of end_date
